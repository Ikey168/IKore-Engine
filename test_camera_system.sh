echo "Key Features Implemented:"
echo "- Perspective projection matrix using GLM"
echo "- View matrix calculation with lookAt functionality"
echo "- Euler angle-based camera rotation (yaw/pitch)"
echo "- Smooth camera movement in 6 directions"
echo "- Dynamic field-of-view adjustments (1-120 degrees)"
echo "- Mouse look with configurable sensitivity"
echo "- Automatic viewport and aspect ratio updates"
echo ""
echo "Technical Highlights:"
echo "- GLM integration for matrix operations"
echo "- RAII-compliant Camera class design"
echo "- Constrained pitch to prevent gimbal lock"
echo "- Normalized camera vectors for stable movement"
echo "- Real-time parameter logging for debugging"
echo "- Delta-time based movement for frame rate independence"
echo ""
echo "Controls in Application:"
echo "- WASD: Move forward/backward/left/right"
echo "- Space: Move up"
echo "- Left Shift: Move down"
echo "- Left Ctrl: Sprint (3x speed)"
echo "- Left Alt: Slow movement (0.3x speed)"
echo "- Mouse: Look around (pitch and yaw)"
echo "- Mouse Scroll: Adjust FOV smoothly"
echo "- Q/E: Decrease/increase FOV by 5¬∞"
echo "- R: Reset FOV to default (45¬∞)"
echo "- Tab: Toggle mouse look on/off"
echo "- ESC: Exit application"

echo "Acceptance Criteria Verification:"
echo "‚úÖ The camera renders a perspective scene"
echo "‚úÖ Adjusting the FOV updates the projection correctly"
echo "‚úÖ Camera movement through matrix transformations"
