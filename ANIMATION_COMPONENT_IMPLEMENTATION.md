## üîß Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```cpp
class AnimationComponent : public Component {
    // Core animation state management
    // Bone transformation system (up to 100 bones)
    // Multi-layer animation support
    // Root motion and event system
    // Assimp integration utilities
};
```

### Key Data Structures
- **`Bone`**: Hierarchical bone with keyframe data (position, rotation, scale)
- **`Animation`**: Collection of bones with duration and timing information
- **`BoneInfo`**: Bone mapping with ID and offset matrix
- **`AnimatedVertex`**: Vertex structure with bone weights and indices

### Memory Management
- Smart pointer usage throughout (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)
- RAII principles for resource cleanup
- Efficient bone matrix storage and updates

## üé¨ Animation Pipeline

1. **Loading**: AnimationLoader extracts animations from Assimp scenes
2. **Processing**: Bone keyframes converted to engine format
3. **Runtime**: Real-time interpolation and bone matrix calculation
4. **Rendering**: Final bone matrices sent to shaders for vertex transformation

## üìà Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized bone matrix storage (4x4 matrices per bone)
- **CPU Optimized**: Efficient keyframe interpolation algorithms
- **Scalable**: Supports up to 100 bones per character
- **Cache Friendly**: Contiguous memory layout for bone data

## üîÆ Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Animation State Machines**: Complex character behavior systems
2. **GPU Acceleration**: Compute shader-based bone transformations
3. **Animation Compression**: Reduced memory footprint for large animations
4. **Animation Retargeting**: Cross-character animation sharing
5. **IK (Inverse Kinematics)**: Procedural animation adjustments
6. **Animation Mirroring**: Symmetric animation generation
